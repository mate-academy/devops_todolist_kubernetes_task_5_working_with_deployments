# Django ToDo list

This is a todo list web application with basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a kubernetes manifest for a pod which will containa ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a `deployment.yml` file with a deployment for the app.
1. Deployment should have
    1. Strategy: RollingUpdate
    1. Resource requests and limits (in idle state you should have 2 pods running)
    1. Pod spec should be same as for pods manifest
1. Createa a `hpa.yml` file with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the app.
1. Autoscaler should define
    1. Minimum number of pods as 2
    2. Maximum number of pods as 5
    3. Autoscale should be triggered by both CPU and Memory
1. Both new manifests should belong to `mateapp` namespace
1. `README.md` should be updated with the instructions on how to deploy the app to k8s
1. `README.md` Should have explained you choice of resources requests and limits
1. `README.md` Should have explained your choice of HPA configuration
1. `README.md` Should have explained your strategy configuration (Why such numbers)
1. `README.md` Should have explained how to access the app after deployment
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.

## To deploy this app you need to use this commands:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

```
kubectl apply -f hpa.yml
```

## FAQ

***

### Why do I choose these requests and limits?
```
 requests:
   memory: "512Mi"
   cpu: "2400m"
 limits:
   memory: "1024Mi"
   cpu: "2400m"
```
 Because In order to maintain no more than two pods in a running stable state, 
 I set these limits based on the characteristics of the PC ON WHICH I deploy the application
 
***

### Why do I choose these HPA configuration?
```
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 5
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```
To distribute the load to other pods in case there are not enough resources.
Int his case up to five

***

### Why do I choose these strategy configuration?
```
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
```
These options provide a balance between availability and 
reliability when updating this application on Kubernetes.
