# Django ToDo list

This is a to-do list web application with the basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a Kubernetes manifest for a pod that will contain a ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a `deployment.yml` file with a deployment for the app.
1. Deployment should have
    1. Strategy: RollingUpdate
    1. Resource requests and limits (in the idle state you should have 2 pods running)
    1. Pod spec should be same as for pods manifest
1. Create a `hpa.yml` file with a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the app.
1. Autoscaler should define
    1. Minimum number of pods as 2
    2. Maximum number of pods as 5
    3. Autoscale should be triggered by both CPU and Memory
1. Both new manifests should belong to `mateapp` namespace
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` should be created with the instructions on how to deploy the app to k8s
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` Should have explained your choice of resource requests and limits
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` Should have explained your choice of HPA configuration
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` Should have explained your strategy configuration (Why such numbers)
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` Should have explained how to access the app after deployment
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.


README updated

1. kubectl create namespace mateapp (and update namespace on other files from .infrastructure folder)
2. Create Deployment manifest:
Resource Requests and Limits been choosen to to ensure high availability and load distribution for 2 pods, and prevents any single pod from hogging resources.
3. Create HPA manifest:
Ensure there are always at least 2 pods running for availability and allow scaling up to 5 pods based on CPU and Memory usage to handle variable loads efficiently.
4. kubectl apply -f nodeport.yml -n mateapp (forward -port to config  an accessiblety from browsr and visit http://<node-ip>:30080
 )
5. The RollingUpdate strategy updates the application with zero downtime by allowing only one pod to be unavailable and adding one extra pod temporarily to speed up the process.
